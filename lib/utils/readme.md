# TS Utils [![JSR](https://jsr.io/badges/@nikiv/utils)](https://jsr.io/@nikiv/utils)

See exported functions in [src](src) or in nice published page on [JSR](https://jsr.io/@nikiv/utils).

## Usage

In repo you want to import package in:

```
bunx jsr add @nikiv/utils
```

Other import options can be seen on [JSR page](https://jsr.io/@nikiv/utils).

Can also clone repo and [bun link](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/link) it.

```
bun link
```

Then in repo you want to link package from:

```
bun link @nikiv/ts-utils
```

## Setup

```
bun i
```

## Run

Currently I write functions in [src](src) and test them by running:

```
bun sr
```

Which runs a gitignored `scripts/p-run.ts` file. Or I test functions through tests with bun.
