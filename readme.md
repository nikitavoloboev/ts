## Flow

> CLI to do things fast

See [cli/flow](cli/flow).

## Other code

There is other code here like packages or me trying some code out.

## Contributing

Any PR to improve is welcome. I do most of the dev with [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) & hand writing code with [Cursor](https://cursor.com). But I would love good **working** & **useful** patches (ideally).
